# Visual Algorithms

Project for interactive visualization of algorithms and data structures.

## Description
This application lets you visually explore how different algorithms (sorting, searching, etc.) and data structures (lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs) work. Ideal for learning, teaching, and experimenting in an intuitive way.

## Useful Commands

### Install dependencies

### Run tests
```bash
npm test
```

### Build for production
```bash
npm run build
```
